You may produce your own browsers for the Massive Server without consultation, provided you use the
Massive Server application.

To modify the Massive network and database protocol, first contact the owner, 
or discuss on GitHub, as there are likely many dependencies.

Further than that, in the Open World Browser, you may change and make enhancements, use it as a base for your own
virtual universe browsers that connect to the Massive Network.
