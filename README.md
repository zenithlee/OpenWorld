## *first run*
Easiest is to download the Deploy.zip release file under Releases.  
Run The MassiveServer on a Windows Machine  
Run OpenWorldMinimum to show basic login flow  
Run OpenWorld to get a basic 3D browser, with crafting. Use this as a starting point for new browsers.  


## *Loading Terrain*
Using Bing-type tiles  
Each tile has a biome map (generated by the generator project, which connects to an OpenStreetMap server)  
Generates Height, texture, and data files.  
Data file has details of roads, buildings, water, etc. Units: Lon/Lat  
  
## *UserID*
Each new user is identified by a GUID generated by the server on first login  
The client should store the GUID for later logins.  
A client can associate a GUID with an email address to retrieve their account and data  

## *Logging in flow*
Use the OpenWorldMinimum to examine basic login flow.  
When creating your own browsers use this flow.
The Browser must first get the Lobby file from [http://BigFun.co.za/massive/lobby/]  
Returns a JSON file of all registered servers  
The lobby Form is shown, user selects the desired server  
Select a server, and call the following in order,  
Each server call will have a response  
call: Globals.Network.ConnectToServerRequest  
returns: Globals.Network.ConnectToServer  
call:		Globals.Network.ConnectToMassive (connect to actual universe)  
returns: Globals.Network.Connected  
call:			Globals.Network.Login  
with a valid email and password  
returns: Globals.NetworkLoggedIn  
the UserID is returned in the loggedin packet.  
The Globals.UserAccount is now populated with login details.  

On success, the user can now GETWORLD to get a list of nearby objects.  Promiximity is throttled by the server.  
Set the user's position with Globals.Network.AvatarMoveRequest  
As the user moves around updated JSON lists are returned by the server, allowing client app to spawn nearby objects  
Destroying and disposing objects is at the discretion of the client  
Use other functions like CreateObjectRequest to create objects and associate them with current user  

## *Message Bus*
All components communicate through the Message bus - MMessageBus, or Globals.Network for net comms  
Call static methods to request actions.  
e.g. MMessageBus.ChangeAvatarRequest(this, Globals.UserAccount.UserID, "DOG01") to change the current user's avatar  
to the model loaded into template with TemplateID and name DOG01  
The server will response with a Globals.Network.AvatarChange handler call  
  
## *Network*
Network runs on its own threads.  
Use Massive2.Network to make network requests.  
Server is source of truth, so all movement, spawn, chat, gets approved by server before broadcast.  
MMessageBus will intercept some server messages relating to UI, and invoke them on the UI thread.  
So use MMessageBus event handlers rather than network ones.  


## Chat
Chat is still primitive, with limited friends lists, etc
