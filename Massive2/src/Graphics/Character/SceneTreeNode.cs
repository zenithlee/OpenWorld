    ///     
    ///     Once we have that, we should check game logic using the new positions.
    ///     
    ///     After this, we should render everything by calling render on the root node,
    ///     which will display everything in the world. (Obviously we should have some
    ///     sort of frustum culling here.) We pass in the view and projection matrices,
