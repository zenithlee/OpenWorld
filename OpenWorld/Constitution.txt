We are creating a new internet (Axis Mundi) comprising interconnected virtual worlds, 
and are coming up to open beta.

We want to know your thoughts on foundational human rights in the new internet.
Given that the current internet is a list( as opposed to the intended tree-graph), with the 'game' being to get to the top of the list, 
recreating the internet as a spatial structure while maintaining the advantages of interconnected sites seems the logical next step in its evolution.

## Please help us draft the Constitution. ##
